A game where you try to guess all 50 states of America.

The game asks you to guess a state and if it exists it shows you where it is on the map.
If you can't guess anymore insert exit and the program finishes and provides you with a csv file with the states you did not find.

The game is written in python as a small project to learn to utilize the Pandas package.
It's a simple recreation of this game: https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states
